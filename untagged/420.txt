Actualized Intelligence: Planning and Acting in Dynamic Environments

			Kris Hammond
		    University of Chicago

Over the past few years, the thrust of research in planning has moved
away from the notion of a plan as a proof and more towards an approach
that integrates planning and execution.  Rather than building systems that
produce plans, researchers are more concerned with systems that
produce behavior in the face of a changing world.  This change in
focus opens up a wide variety of new problems that ``planners'' have
to deal with.

In this talk, I will discuss one view of these issues and outline an
approach for dealing with them that combines what has been labeled
``case-based planning'' with a reactive componant and a learning
mechanism that uses run-time expectation failures to focus the
planner's attention on gaps in its knowledge base.  In terms of
planning, the system is able to recover from many execution-time
failures as well as capitalize on unforseen opportunities.  In terms
of learning, it is able to learn from both run-time opportunities and
unexpected execution problems.
