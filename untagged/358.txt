 TITLE: FILTERS FOR IMAGE RESAMPLING

A common problem in image processing is resampling a raster image.
This task crops up when removing distortions from satellite images and
when performing texture mapping in computer graphics, for example.
Careful filtering must be done during resampling or the results will
appear blocky or show aliasing.  Traditionally, most research in
resampling has addressed special cases.  Often, the class of mappings
is restricted to be affine (translation, rotation, and scaling), in
which case the filter is space invariant.  Furthermore, filters are
often designed for interpolation (upsampling) only or decimation
(downsampling) only.

In this talk, we develop a unified theory for image resampling filters,
which subsumes previous methods for affine mappings, interpolation, and
decimation.  The theory describes the space variant filter for
resampling a multidimensional signal according to an arbitrary mapping
without aliasing.  A simple, fast approximation technique employing
elliptical Gaussian filters will be demonstrated.
