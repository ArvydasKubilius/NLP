 TITLE:  Dante II and Beyond: Exploration Robots

In the summer of 1994, Dante II successfully descended into the crater
of an active Alaskan volcano using a combination of walking and
rappelling locomotion. While linked by satellite to a very remote base
station, Dante relied on a suite of sensors and semi-autonomous
operational modes to traverse the very challenging terrain. Once at
the crater floor, fumarole gas data and detailed video images in
addition to high resolution laser-built terrain reconstructions were
viewed live by scientists in several US locations. During its ascent
out of the crater, Dante tipped over while attempting to climb a steep
side slope of muddy ash and had to be recovered.

Much was learned in this fast-paced, high risk research project in
areas ranging from robot configuration to telepresence control to
field operations and logistics.  One measure of the success of the
Dante II research is the degree by which the lessons learned can be
articulated, communicated and applied to future generations of
exploration robots.
