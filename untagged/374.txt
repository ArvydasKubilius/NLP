 SPEAKER:  Rajive Bagrodia
           Computer Science Dept., UCLA

 TOPIC:    Iterative Design of Efficient Parallel Programs

 DATE:     Friday, September 18, 1992

 TIME:     2:30 pm

 PLACE:    Wean Hall 4605

This talk describes an environment to derive efficient parallel
implementations from program specifications using stepwise 
refinement.  The environment is built around a data parallel
notation called UC.  Novel aspects of UC include:

* support for the design of rapid prototypes 
* incremental refinements for efficiency via dynamic data 
  distributions and progressively weaker synchronizations
* portability across synchronous and asynchronous architectures
* simple control-flow constructs to ensure that correctness 
  proofs are no more complicated than for equivalent 
  sequential programs.

A UC compiler is available for the CM-2; a sequential emulator 
for UC is also available and a multicomputer implementation 
is in progress.  Measurements of the UC compiler on selected 
numerical and graph applications will be presented.
