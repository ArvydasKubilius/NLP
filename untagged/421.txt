Abstract: 

		 Master of Software Engineering (MSE)                 
     Final End-of-Semester Presentation of the Studio 92-93 Team

                    ------------------------------        
		    "Hasta La Vista, Tessellator!"
                    ------------------------------        

			    SEI Auditorium
		December 3 from 11:00 am to 12:00 noon
The MSE 92-93 studio team will present a final review of its T2 project,
the development of software for the Tessellator robot. The Tessellator 
is designed by the Field Robotics Center to service the tiles of NASA's
Space Shuttles. The T2 team contributes the positioning system for the
robot's manipulator and part of the high-level controller. 

The presentation will cover two topics:

1. Project Summary

   This part will describe the Tessellator project and highlight the 
   T2 team's contributions.

2. Requirements Engineering

   This part will focus on an area the T2 team considers to be crucial
   in software development: requirements engineering. The presentation
   will discuss the challenges faced by the team and the methods (such
   as formal specification and peer reviews) used to tackle the problems.
