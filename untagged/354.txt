I will describe our research in automating the kinematic analysis of
rigid part mechanisms, such as gears, cylinder locks, clutches, and
transmissions.  Kinematic analysis determines the constraints on the
behavior of a mechanism imposed by the shapes of its parts and by the
contacts among them.  Automating the analysis is an important step
toward automating the overall design and analysis of mechanisms.  The
computational complexity of kinematic analysis depends on the shapes
and motion types of the parts of the mechanism, and is in general
intractable.  We have identified engineering restrictions on part
shapes and interactions that make kinematic analysis feasible.  Most
mechanisms belong to the feasible class according to a survey of 2500
mechanisms in a standard mechanical engineering encyclopedia.  We have
developed an efficient kinematic analysis program for feasible
mechanisms.  The program derives the motion of the parts for given
input motions and internal forces, such as gravity and friction.  It
uses a simple model of dynamics that captures the steady-state effect
of forces without the conceptual and computational cost of traditional
dynamical simulation.  It generates a compact, symbolic behavioral
description and a realistic, three-dimensional animation.  It can also
generate the space of behaviors for all possible input motions.
