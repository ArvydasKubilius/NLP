Abstract: 

 Title:			Computer vision and geometric measurement

 Visitor/Speaker:	Dr. Kam W. Wong
 			Professor of Civil Engineering
 			University of Illinois at Urbana-Champagne

 Date:			Friday, March 20th

Seminar time:		3:30-4:30, Adamson Wing, Baker Hall
			(Refreshments served at 3:15)
Some of the fundamental problems associated with the use of computer vision
systems for fully automated geometric measurements will be discussed,
 including: geometric distortion characteristics of vision systems, methods
 of geometric calibration, target identification and centroiding, model
 integration, and surface modeling.  A vision system that has been developed
 to measure the shape, volume, and surface area of human bodies will be used
 as the focus for discussion.

Biographical sketch:

Kam W. Wong is a Professor of Civil Engineering at the University of
Illinois at Urbana-Champagne.  He has had over twenty-five years of research
experience in analytical photogrammetry.  In the past five years, his
research efforts have been directed to the development of methodologies for
using computer vision systems for metric measurement in engineering
construction, automated manufacturing, and bioengineering.  He is currently
co-chair of a working group on digital and real-time photogrammetry in the
International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing.
