                              WHAT IS REASONING?
                          HEURISTIC SEARCH REVISITED

In  the  history of research on thinking two (or more) distinct traditions have
persisted.  One tradition, deriving from the study of language and logic, views
thinking  as  a form of logical and verbal reasoning.  The other, deriving from
the study of human problem solving, views thinking as a  process  of  heuristic
search  through  a mental representation of a problem situation.  The talk will
use recent findings from research on  human  thinking  to  review  the  present
status and future prospects within A.I. of these two paradigms.
