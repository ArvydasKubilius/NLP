Running and juggling are examples of intermittent dynamic tasks.  That
is, they require a manipulator alternately to be in contact with and
out of contact with another object, and the relative velocity at
contact is large.  During the noncontact, or "ballistic" phase, the
manipulator loses the ability to control some of the degrees of freedom
of the overall system.  The ballistic phase ends with an impact as
contact is re-established.  The general control strategy for a
manipulator faced with such a task is two-fold.  During the contact
phase, the manipulator must establish appropriate initial conditions
for the ballistic phase.  During the ballistic phase, it must prepare
for the inevitable impact.

How well do established control laws for running and juggling fit with
this idea of alternately establishing initial conditions and preparing
for impact?  I'll discuss Marc Raibert's control law for running that
decomposes the problem along the degrees of freedom of the mechanism,
and Martin Buhler's use of a "mirror" algorithm for juggling.
