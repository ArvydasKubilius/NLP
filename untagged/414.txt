Abstract: 

	Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center (PSC)/Computer Systems Seminar

	Scalable Parallel Computing Meets Mainstream Computing 

			 Marc Snir 
		   IBM T. J. Watson Lab.

	Friday,  Oct 8, Wean Hall 5409, 4:00 p.m.

The recently announced IBM 9076 Scalable POWERparallel 1 (9076 SP1) system
is the first in a family of scalable systems for serial and parallel
applications.   The SP1 leverages on the RISC/6000 technology, and each node
is the equivalent of a workstation that provides a standard Unix AIX
interface.  Thus, the SP1 provides all the functionality of a cluster of
workstations.  In addition, it provides system integration, hardware support
for high performance communication and a parallel programming environment.
This design point has obvious advantages: leverage on commodity technology,
and full support of all interfaces available on a workstation for serial
applications (Unix AIX, virtual memory, Unix file system, IP connectivity,
compilers, libraries, etc.).  On the other hand, since standard Unix is not
``parallel aware'', a separate parallel operating environment needs to be
created, in support of parallelism.  The talk will discuss some of the
technological trade-offs between ``commodization'' and customization, and
speculate on the likely evolution of systems that attend to preserve
standard uniprocessor interfaces, while supporting efficient scalable
parallel computing.
