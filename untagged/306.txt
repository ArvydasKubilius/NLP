pSather is a set of parallel and distributed extensions to the
object-oriented serial language Sather. After some years of internal
experience with implementations and applications, the pSather 1.0 system is
being developed for portability and general distribution.  pSather addresses
NUMA architectures such as networks of workstations, but provides a relaxed
consistency shared-memory model to the programmer. A goal of the language is
to suport the construction of efficient reusable classes in which the
parallelism is implicit to the user.  Explicit language support is provided
for objects spread over nodes at the same local address and for parallel and
distributed control regimes.  A distinguished class GATE generalizes
previous low-level synchronization mechanisms such as locks, futures and
conditions.  The object-orientation of pSather allows users to define other
synchronization classes which are easy to use, safe, fair, and difficult to
deadlock.  Object-orientation also facilitates the construction of efficient
scalable data structures by allowing reuse of serial code distributed over
the system without an implicit synchronization penalty.
