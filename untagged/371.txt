Creating Clear and Engaging Assignments

Instructors create assignments for many different purposes including,
among others, to provide low-risk learning or practice opportunities
before exams, to evaluate students' mastery of lecture or textbook
material, to enhance in-class learning with complementary material, and
to engage students in exploratory or creative activities.  We will
describe the criteria for clear and appropriate assignments as well as
pool participants' examples to generate ideas to make assignments as
engaging as possible.
