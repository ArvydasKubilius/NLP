SEMINARS ON TEACHING
The six seminars below count toward the Documentation of Teaching
Development Program.  

Planning Effective Lectures
        Wednesday, June 7, 2:00 - 3:30 PM, Carnegie Conference Room,
Warner Hall
Even though all of us have observed hundreds of lectures as students,
the process of preparing an effective lecture raises many new questions.
 How much material should be presented?  How can an instructor keep
students' attention?  How can we tell if students understand the
material?  Participants in this seminar will examine the numerous
factors bearing on how lectures can be most effective by analyzing
videotapes of successful CMU lecturers.
