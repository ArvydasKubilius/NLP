 TITLE:	Elemental measurements in vision.

What are the "elements" of early vision? I will discuss a unifying framework under which the basic visual measurements can be derived in a consistent manner.  First we must consider the structure of the
light in which a visual organism is immersed; this may be formalized with the "plenoptic function," which is related to Gibson's concept of the optic array.  Derivative operators on this function produce measurements of form, motion, color, flicker, disparity, and so on. We can derive a kind of periodic table of early vision.

I will also discuss some of our work on early vision using "steerable filters" and "steerable pyramids" to analyze orientation, scale, local energy, and so on.  The steerable pyramid has advantages over other multiscale image decompositions -- including the currently popular orthogonal wavelet transforms.
