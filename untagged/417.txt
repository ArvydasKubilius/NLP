The EPAM Model of Experts' Discrimination and Learning: Implications for AI
by Herbert Simon

EPAM is a program (the first version was Ed Feigenbaum's thesis) that
learns to discriminate among, hence recognize, symbol structures.  Its
employs a discrimination net, and a learning process that grows the
net by exposure to symbol structures and feedback of its success or
failure in classification.

EPAM was designed as a psychological theory of human perception and
memory, and has been tested (successfully) with human data in a wide
range of experimental paradigms.  It belongs to the small set of
"unified" theories of cognition, though like SOAR or ACT*, it covers
only a part of the waterfront.

Apart from psychology, EPAM exhibits a set of mechanisms of
considerable relevance to general theories of learning and concept
attainment, as well as memory organization.  For example, it was an
ancestor of the RETE nets used in production systems, and can be
viewed as a large indexed data base.  The talk will discuss these and
other points of relevance of EPAM to current research in AI.
