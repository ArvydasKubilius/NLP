Canada is participating in the international Space Station
Freedom Program through the development and operation of
the Mobile Servicing System (MSS) which will play a critical 
role in the assembly, maintenance and servicing of the 
station. The MSS is a robotic system featuring a large
manipulator for large payloads and two smaller manipulators
for dextrous tasks. The MSS manipulators can be operated
either manually by astronauts or in automatic modes. 
Advanced control system features and stringent requirements
on performance and safety present technical challenges
for the design and development of the MSS control system.
