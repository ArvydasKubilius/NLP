Abstract: 

Appended is the calendar for Fall joint CS-PSC seminar series.  
I will post weekly reminders with an abstract.

All seminars are on Friday at 4, unless otherwise noted.  Most 
speakers spend some time in Pittsburgh to find out about ongoing 
research.  Please contact Barbara Sandling if you want to talk to 
the speaker,

Peter
