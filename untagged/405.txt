  Recent years have witnessed increasing interest in the theoretical
  aspects of real-time programming.  This has been fueled by the high
  costs associated with the failure of real-time systems.  This talk
  presents an extension of the testing paradigm of De Nicola and
  Hennessy for concurrent processes to reasoning about reactive
  real-time processes.  We generate testing preorders that relate
  processes on the basis of their timing behavior as well as their
  degree of relative nondeterminism.  The framework is then applied
  to two different scenarios.  In the first, relations are constructed
  that relate processes on the basis of all timing considerations.  In
  the second, relations are constructed that relate processes on the
  basis of their relative speeds.  We then isolate a realistic class
  of reactive systems that can be compared on the basis of their
  relative speeds.  An algebra is then developed for such processes,
  and examples are given to illustrate the utility of the approach.
