Seminars on Teaching

Planning Effective Lectures 
  Wednesday, February 1, 4:15 - 6:15 PM, Carnegie Conference Room, Warner Hall
Even though all of us have observed hundreds of lectures as students,
the process of preparing an effective lecture is anything but
transparent.  How much material should be presented?  How can an
instructor keep students' attention?  How can instructors tell if
students understand the material?  By examining brief videotape excerpts
of successful CMU faculty, participants in this seminar will examine the
numerous factors bearing on how lectures can be most effective.  This
seminar counts toward the Documentation of Teaching Development program.
