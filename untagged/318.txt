Structures of dynamic scenes can only be recovered using a real-time
range sensor. Depth from defocus  offers an elegant solution to fast
and dense range estimation. It is computational efficient as it
circumvents the correspondence problem faced by stereo and the feature
tracking problem involved in structure from motion. However, accurate
depth estimation requires theoretical and practical solutions to a
variety of problems including  recovery of textureless surfaces,
blur estimation, and magnification variations caused by defocusing. 
Both textured and textureless surfaces are recovered using an
optimized illumination pattern that is projected via the same optical
path used to acquire images. A prototype focus range sensor has been
developed that produces up to 512x480 depth estimates at 30 Hz with
an accuracy of 0.3%.

In addition to the above topic, I'll briefly summarize recent results
on diffuse reflectance and visual learning.
