Abstract: 

On Tuesday Sept. 10, Michelle Messenger, the project coordinator for the
visualization software apE, will give a short slide presentation (~20 min)
in WeH 4623 at 3:30PM. All is invited to attend.
Briefly, apE is one of the dominating packages in scientific visualization.
It is developed at the Ohio Supercomputer Center and distributed as public
domain software at the source code level. In recent years, both apE and AVS
(the leading commercial visualization software) have pioneered many
concepts/features that shaped the major themes in visualization tools. apE
claims an installation base of over 800 sites internationally. The short
presentation will give an overview of apE and the OSC visualization project.
