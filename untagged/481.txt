       The Friend21 Project is a MITI sponsored effort to
       develop a comfortable personal information system
       for the 21st century.  A major concern is the user
       interface, and one approach under current study is
       the development of rich interface agents.  This talk
       will discuss the user interface for Friend21 and
       present recent progress toward the project's goals.
