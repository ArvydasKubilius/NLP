Abstract: 

Prof Patterson has demonstrated classical "absent-minded
professor" symptoms.  The abstract posted a few days ago
is not the talk that he plans to give.  Instead, he appears
to be giving the talk we saw last spring in our Distinguished
Lecture Series.  It was good then, so if you missed it or
would like a reprise, come tomorrow evening.    ----  garth

	         West Coast Computer Science Colloquium

		      Terabytes >> Teraflops
	Or why work on processors when I/O is where the action is?

			David A. Patterson
	   Professor and Chair, Computer Science Division,
	  EECS Department, University of California, Berkeley

                        7:15 - 8:15 pm
                        4623 Wean Hall
                (via Picturetel from Berkeley)
                moderated locally by Garth Gibson
[[[[[[  This is likely to be similar to the distinguished lecture given by
	Patterson here at CMU last spring.    ---  garth  ]]]]]]]

Amdahl's Law tells us with faster processors we
need faster and larger I/O. Unfortunately disks are getting smaller rather
than faster.  This talk describes the results of the RAID project
(Redundant Arrays of Inexpensive Disks), which offers much
greater performance, capacity, and reliablity from I/O systems.

I will also talk about a new project getting underway called Sequoia 2000,
which looks at utilizing small helical scan tapes, such as
digital-audio tapes or video tapes, to offer terabytes of
storage for the price of a fileserver. (Sequoia 2000 is the Digital
Equipment Corporation funded successor to MIT's Project Athena;
it promises terabytes of economical and low latency storage
for global change scientists at the University of California.)

My thesis is that a factor of 1000 increase in storage capacity available
on most Ethernets will have a much greater impact than a factor of
1000 increase in processing speed for a gaggle of scientists.
