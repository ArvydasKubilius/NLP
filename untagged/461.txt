"Some Necessary Conditions for a Good User Interface"

For our final Human-Computer Interaction seminar of the semester, Raj Reddy
will be presenting his thoughts on what makes a good interface good.  He
hopes the discussion of "necessary conditions" can serve as a source for
new HCI research ideas.  Should be a thought-provoking way to transition to
the summer!
